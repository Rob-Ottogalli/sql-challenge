3. **03_SQL Code**. This folder contins 2 .SQL files. DB_Creation.sql is the code output from Quickdatabasediagrams.com, formatted for PostgreSQL; when imported into PostgreSQL, this will generate the Tables used to hold the data in the EmployeeSQL database. DB_Query.sql is the code to generate 8 queries on the data in the EmployeeSQL database.
4. **04_Bonus**. This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook labeled "Exploratory Analysis.ipynb", which imports the data from the EmployeeSQL database via SQLAlchemy and analyzes key salary trends. The Observations.md explains the common trends. The Images folder contains images that were generated in the Jupyter Notebook and were used in the Observations file.
